## Course Overview and Learning Objectives 

**Brief Description:** 

This course introduces the basics of carrying out a statistical analysis in Python. It covers exploratory data analysis, constructing and interpreting linear and generalized linear models, and introduces Bayesian modelling. 

**Aims, Objectives and Intended Learning Outcomes:** 

**Chapter 1: Exploratory Data Analysis**

By the end of Chapter 1, learners should know:

*   What is tidy data?
    *   What is a variable, value, and observation?
    *   Several python commands to explore the structure of the data
    *   What is the difference between a continuous and categorical variable?
    *   What is variation and covariation?
*  Where Exploratory Data Analysis fits within data analysis?
    *   How to use plots to explore variation in 
        *	A continuous variable
        *	A categorical variable
    *   How to use plots to explore covariation between
        *	Two categorical variables
        *	Two continuous variables
        *	A categorical and continuous variable. 

**Chapter 2: Model Basics**

By the end of Chapter 2, learners should know:

*   Model Basics
    *	 What is a model family and fitted model?
    *	 What is the difference between a response and an explanatory variable?
    
*   Model Construction
    *  How to construct a linear model in python?
    *  What are the slope and intercept in a linear model?
    *  Picking out key information from the model table
    *  How to extract specific parameters from the model object.

*  Assessing Model Fit
    *	 How to inspect model residuals to assess model fit?
    *	 How to pick out key information from the table from a fitted model. 
    *  How to use Adjusted R-squared and AIC to compare models. 

**Chapter 3: Generalized Linear Models**

By the end of Chapter 3, learners should know

* What is probability? 

* What is a random variable?

* What a probability distribution is and how it differs for continuous vs. discrete random variables?
* Be familiar with several common probability distributions used to model variation in the response variable
  * Binomial
  * Normal
  * Poisson
  * Negative Binomial

* How to implement a generalized linear model in python.

**Chapter 4: Bayesian Analysis**
By the end of Chapter 4, learners should know

* What is Baye's rule and how it is used in Bayesian statistics?
* How Bayesian and Frequentist schools of thought differ?
* How to implement a simple Bayesian linear model in python.

## Rough guide to files

The self-learning materials (notes) is all in Stats4DS.html. The slides for this material are in "Stats4DS_Slides.html (Chapters 1, 2, 3), and Intro_Bayes_Slides.html (Chapter 4)". 

The self-learning material makes reference to different practicals which are independent notebooks in the Practicals folder. The order of the practicals is as follows:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (Chapter 1)
2. Generalized Linear Models (Chapter 3)
3. Intro_Bayes (Chapter 4)

Each practical has a python notebook and instructions are self-contained. 

There are also short-exercises within the self-learning materials.
